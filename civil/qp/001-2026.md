# Fundamentals of Surveying - Part 2

## Introduction
In the previous session (Part 1), the classification of surveying based on accuracy was discussed: **Plane Surveying** and **Geodetic Surveying**.
* **Plane Surveying:** Earth's curvature is ignored; plumb lines are parallel.
* **Geodetic Surveying:** Earth's curvature is taken into account; plumb lines converge at the earth's center. Used for areas larger than $250 \text{ km}^2$.

This session focuses on further classifications of surveying, fundamental principles, and units of measurement.

## Classification of Surveys

Surveying can be classified based on three primary criteria:
1.  **Nature of the field of survey.**
2.  **Object of the survey.**
3.  **Instruments used.**

### 1. Classification Based on Nature of the Field
This classification depends on where the survey is conducted (land, water, or sky).

* **Land Survey:** Performed on the surface of the earth. It is further sub-divided into:
    * **Topographical Survey:** Used to determine the **natural features** of a country such as rivers, streams, hills, and valleys. It also includes artificial features.
    * **Cadastral Survey (Revenue Survey):** Used to **fix the boundaries** of municipalities, states, and federal jurisdictions. It is primarily done for property definition and legal transfer of land.
    * **City Survey:** Conducted in connection with the construction of streets, water supply systems, sewers, and other works within a city.
* **Marine or Hydrographic Survey:** Deals with water bodies (for navigation, water supply, harbor construction).
* **Astronomical Survey:** Observations made to heavenly bodies to determine absolute locations.

### 2. Classification Based on the Object of Survey
This classification is based on the specific purpose or objective of the survey.

* **Engineering Survey:** Used to collect data for designing engineering projects like roads, railways, dams, and reservoirs.
* **Military Survey:** Conducted to determine points of **strategic importance**.
* **Mine Survey:** Carried out for exploring **mineral wealth** beneath the earth's surface.
* **Geological Survey:** Used to determine the different **strata of the earth's crust**.
* **Archaeological Survey:** Conducted to unearth **relics of antiquity** (ancient civilizations, ruins).

### 3. Classification Based on Instruments Used
Named after the primary instrument employed during the survey:
* Chain Surveying
* Compass Surveying
* Leveling
* Plane Table Surveying
* Theodolite Surveying
* Tacheometric Surveying
* Photogrammetric Surveying
* EDM (Electronic Distance Measurement) Surveying

## Measurements in Surveying
Surveying primarily involves determining relative positions. The basic measurements taken are:
1.  Horizontal distances
2.  Vertical distances
3.  Horizontal angles
4.  Vertical angles

To locate a point, a combination of these measurements is used.

## Principles of Surveying

There are two fundamental principles of surveying that must be strictly followed.

### Principle 1: Location of a point by measurement from two points of reference
* To locate a new point (e.g., C), measurements must be taken from two distinct fixed points of reference (e.g., A and B) which form a known line (Base line).
* The position of C can be defined using:
    * Two distances (AC and BC).
    * Two angles ($\angle CAB$ and $\angle CBA$).
    * One distance and one angle (Distance AC and $\angle CAB$).

### Principle 2: Working from Whole to Part (Most Important)
* **Concept:** The surveyor must establish a system of control points with high precision covering the **whole area** first. Then, the survey proceeds to fill in the details within these control points (working inwards).
* **Purpose:**
    * To **prevent the accumulation of errors**.
    * To **localize minor errors**.
* **Explanation:**
    * If you work from **Part to Whole** (starting small and expanding outwards), a small error in the initial step gets magnified and accumulated as the survey progresses, leading to large uncontrollable errors at the end.
    * By working from **Whole to Part**, any error committed in the details is confined to that specific section and does not affect the main framework.

## Basic Units of Measurement

Understanding units is crucial for field work and conversions.

### British Units (Length)
* 12 inches = 1 foot
* 3 feet = 1 yard
* 5.5 yards = 1 rod / pole
* 4 poles = 1 chain
* 10 chains = 1 furlong
* 8 furlongs = 1 mile
* 6 feet = 1 fathom
* 120 fathoms = 1 cable length
* 6080 feet = 1 nautical mile

### Metric Units (Length)
* 10 mm = 1 cm
* 10 cm = 1 dm (decimeter)
* 10 dm = 1 m (meter)
* 10 m = 1 decameter
* 10 decameter = 1 hectometer
* 10 hectometer = 1 km

### Important Length Conversions
* 100 links = 1 Chain (Standard Gunter's Chain)
* 1 Mile $\approx$ 1.609 km
* 1 Nautical Mile $\approx$ 1.852 km

### Area Units
* 144 sq inches = 1 sq foot
* 9 sq feet = 1 sq yard
* 40 sq rods = 1 rood
* 4 roods = 1 acre
* 640 acres = 1 sq mile
* **10 sq chains = 1 acre**

### Metric Area Units
* 100 sq mm = 1 sq cm
* 100 sq m = 1 Are
* 100 Ares = 1 Hectare ($10^4 \text{ m}^2$)
* 100 Hectares = 1 sq km
