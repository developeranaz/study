# Topic: Fundamentals of Surveying (Part 2)

## 1. Recap of Part 1 🌍
* **Primary Divisions:** Surveying is primarily divided into Plane Surveying and Geodetic Surveying.
    * **Plane Surveying:** Earth's curvature is ignored (plumb lines are parallel). Used for smaller areas.
    * **Geodetic Surveying:** Earth's curvature is taken into account (plumb lines converge at the earth's center). Used for areas greater than 250 km².

## 2. Classification of Surveys 📋
Surveying can be classified in three main ways:

### A. Based on the Nature of the Field
* **Land Survey:** Surveying done on land.
* **Marine / Hydrographic Survey:** Surveying done on water bodies.
* **Astronomical Survey:** Observations related to heavenly bodies.

**Sub-classification of Land Surveys:**
* **Topographical Survey:** Used to determine the natural features of a country such as rivers, streams, and hills, as well as artificial features.
* **Cadastral Survey (Revenue Survey):** Used to fix the boundaries of municipalities, states, or properties. This is often called "Revenue Survey".
* **City Survey:** Related to construction work within a city, such as streets, water supply systems, and sewers.

### B. Based on the Object of Survey
* **Engineering Survey:** To collect data for engineering works like dams or roads.
* **Military Survey:** To determine points of strategic importance.
* **Mine Survey:** To explore mineral wealth.
* **Geological Survey:** To study the different strata of the earth's crust.
* **Archaeological Survey:** To unearth relics of antiquity.

### C. Based on Instruments Used 🔭
* Chain Survey
* Compass Survey
* Leveling
* Plane Table Survey
* Theodolite Survey
* Tacheometric Survey
* Photogrammetric Survey
* EDM (Electronic Distance Measurement)

## 3. Basic Measurements 📏
Surveying involves determining relative positions using a combination of:
* Horizontal distances
* Vertical distances
* Horizontal angles
* Vertical angles

## 4. Principles of Surveying ⚖️
There are two fundamental principles that are critical for exams.

### Principle 1: Location of a point by measurement from two points of reference
* To locate a new point (C), you need at least two known reference points (A and B), which form a base line.
* Point C can be located using:
    * Two distances (AC and BC).
    * Two angles (Angle BAC and Angle ABC).
    * One distance and one angle.

### Principle 2: Working from Whole to Part
* **Definition:** You establish a system of control points with high precision for the entire area first (the "Whole"), and then fill in the details (the "Part").
* **Purpose:**
    * To prevent the accumulation of errors.
    * To localize minor errors (confining an error to a small area rather than letting it affect the whole survey).
* **Contrast:** Working from "Part to Whole" is incorrect because errors will accumulate and expand as you proceed.

## 5. Important Units and Conversions 🔄
The lecture emphasizes knowing both British and Metric units, as they are common in fieldwork and exams.

**Length:**
* 1 Nautical Mile ≈ 1.852 km.
* 1 Mile ≈ 1.609 km.
* 100 Links = 1 Chain.
* **Metric Conversions:**
    * 10 mm = 1 cm
    * 100 cm = 1 m
    * 1000 m = 1 km

**Area:**
* 1 Acre = 10 Square Chains. (Important previous question).
* 1 Are = 100 m².
* 1 Hectare = 100 Ares = 10,000 m² (10^4 m²).

## Practice Questions Discussed ❓
* **Question:** Which survey determines natural features like mountains, rivers, and water bodies?
    * **Answer:** Topographical Survey.
* **Question:** Which survey is used to determine additional details such as boundaries of fields?
    * **Answer:** Cadastral Survey.
* **Question:** What is the fundamental principle of surveying?
    * **Answer:** Working from Whole to Part.
