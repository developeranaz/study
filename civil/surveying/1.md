## 3. Basic Definitions

### What is Surveying?
* **Definition:** It is the **art** of determining the **relative positions** of various points above, on, or below the surface of the earth.
* **Key Concept:** Determining "Relative Positions" via measurements of horizontal distances, vertical distances (elevations), and angles.
* **Plane of Measurement:** Surveying primarily deals with measurements in the **Horizontal Plane**.

### What is Leveling?
* **Definition:** A branch of surveying used to find the **elevation** (vertical distance) of points with respect to a given or assumed **datum** (an arbitrary reference surface).
* **Objectives:**
    * To find the elevation of existing points.
    * To establish points at a required elevation/height.
* **Plane of Measurement:** Leveling deals with measurements in the **Vertical Plane**.
    * *Exam Note:* If asked "Leveling deals with measurements in which plane?", the answer is **Vertical Plane**.

## 4. Objectives of Surveying
1.  **To prepare a Map or Plan.**
2.  **To determine relative positions** of existing features on or near the ground.
3.  **To layout or mark positions** of proposed structures (setting out).
4.  **To determine Area and Volume** (e.g., earthwork quantities for embankments).

## 5. Shape of the Earth
* **Actual Shape:** **Oblate Spheroid** (also referred to as Ellipsoid or Ovaloid in some texts).
    * It is flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator.
* **Dimensions (Approximate):**
    * **Polar Axis Length:** ~12,713 km.
    * **Equatorial Axis Length:** ~12,756 km.
    * *Note:* The Equatorial axis is longer than the Polar axis.
* **Difference in Axis Lengths:**
    * Approximately **43 km** (precisely ~42.95 km).
    * Percentage difference: About **0.34%**.

## 6. Primary Divisions of Surveying
Surveying is primarily classified into two types based on whether the curvature of the earth is considered.

### A. Plane Surveying
* **Earth's Curvature:** **Neglected** (The earth's surface is assumed to be flat).
* **Area:** Carried out for small areas, typically **less than 250 km²** (In some exams/texts: < 195.5 km² or < 100 square chains).
* **Lines:** All lines are considered **straight lines**.
* **Triangles:** Triangles formed are **Plane Triangles** (Angles are plane angles).
* **Plumb Lines:** Plumb lines at different points are considered **parallel** to each other.
* **Accuracy:** Lower standard of accuracy.
* **Agencies:** Performed by state agencies (e.g., PWD, Irrigation Dept).

### B. Geodetic Surveying
* **Earth's Curvature:** **Taken into consideration**.
* **Area:** Carried out for large areas, typically **greater than 250 km²**.
* **Lines:** All lines are considered **curved lines**.
* **Triangles:** Triangles formed are **Spherical Triangles** (Angles are spherical angles).
* **Plumb Lines:** Plumb lines are **NOT parallel**; they **intersect/converge at the center of the earth**.
* **Accuracy:** High standard of accuracy (Precise positioning).
* **Purpose:** Used for establishing **Control Points**.
* **Agencies:** Performed by national agencies like the **Survey of India** (GTS - Great Trigonometrical Survey).

### Comparison Summary Table

| Feature | Plane Surveying | Geodetic Surveying |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Curvature** | Neglected (Flat surface) | Considered (Curved surface) |
| **Area** | < 250 km² | > 250 km² |
| **Line Type** | Straight | Curved |
| **Plumb Lines** | Parallel | Intersect at Earth's center |
| **Use Case** | General Engineering Projects | Establishing Control Points |
| **Accuracy** | Low | High |

## 7. Important Exam Values (Accuracy limits)
These specific values highlight when Geodetic surveying becomes necessary.

1.  **Linear Measurement Difference:**
    * For a chord length of **18.2 km** (some texts say 18.5 km), the difference between the arc length (curved) and chord length (straight) is only **0.1 m (10 cm)**.

2.  **Angular Measurement Difference:**
    * For an area of **195.5 km²** (approx. equilateral triangle of 18.2km sides):
    * The difference between the sum of angles of a **Spherical Triangle** and a **Plane Triangle** is only **1 second**.
