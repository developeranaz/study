# Fundamentals of Surveying - Part 3

## 1. Plans and Maps

Surveying primarily aims to prepare plans and maps. Both are graphical representations of features on the earth's surface projected onto a horizontal plane.

### Definition and Difference
* **Plan:** A graphical representation where the **scale is large**. It typically represents small areas (e.g., a building plan).
* **Map:** A graphical representation where the **scale is small**. It typically represents large areas (e.g., a map of India).

### Representation of Details
* Plans generally represent **horizontal distances** and **directions**.
* Topographical maps represent vertical distances (elevation) using **contour lines** in addition to horizontal features.

## 2. Scales

### Definition
Scale is the ratio of the distance marked on the plan (map distance) to the corresponding distance on the ground.

$$\text{Scale} = \frac{\text{Map Distance}}{\text{Ground Distance}}$$

### Classification of Scales
Scales are generally classified based on their magnitude:
1.  **Large Scale:** 1 cm = 10 m or less (e.g., 1 cm = 5 m).
2.  **Medium Scale:** 1 cm = 10 m to 100 m.
3.  **Small Scale:** 1 cm = 100 m or more (e.g., 1 cm = 1000 m).

### Methods of Representing Scale
Scales can be represented in three ways:

1.  **Engineer's Scale:**
    * Represented as an equation, e.g., **1 cm = 10 m**.
    * Commonly used in engineering drawings.

2.  **Representative Fraction (R.F.):**
    * Represented as a fraction where the numerator is always 1 and both numerator and denominator are in the same units.
    * Example: Converting 1 cm = 10 m to R.F.
        * 1 cm / 10 m = 1 cm / (10 * 100 cm) = **1/1000**.
    * This is a unitless ratio (or same units).

3.  **Graphical Scale:**
    * A line drawn on the map divided into equal parts representing ground units.
    * **Advantage:** If the map shrinks over time due to paper material properties, the graphical scale shrinks proportionally. This allows for accurate measurements even after shrinkage, which is not possible with Engineer's scale or R.F. written numerically.

### Key Concepts for Exams
* **Accuracy of a Good Draftsman:** The smallest length a good draftsman can plot accurately is **0.25 mm**.
* **Comparing Scales:** The **larger the denominator** of the Representative Fraction, the **smaller the scale**.
    * Example: Between 1/100 and 1/1000, **1/100 is the larger scale** and 1/1000 is the smaller scale.

## 3. Errors in Scales

### A. Error due to Shrinkage of Map
When a map shrinks, the measured distances using the original scale will be incorrect.

**Shrinkage Factor (S.F.) or Shrinkage Ratio:**
$$\text{Shrinkage Factor} = \frac{\text{Shrunk Length}}{\text{Original Length}}$$
* Alternatively: S.F. = Shrunk Scale / Original Scale.
* The Shrinkage Factor is always **less than 1**.

**Formulas for Correction:**
1.  **Correct Distance:**
    $$\text{Correct Distance} = \frac{\text{Measured Distance on Map}}{\text{Shrinkage Factor}}$$
2.  **Correct Area:**
    $$\text{Correct Area} = \frac{\text{Measured Area on Map}}{(\text{Shrinkage Factor})^2}$$

### B. Error due to Wrong Scale
If a drawing is measured using a scale different from the one it was plotted with (e.g., using a 1:50 scale to measure a drawing made at 1:100):

1.  **Correct Length:**
    $$\text{Correct Length} = \left( \frac{\text{R.F. of Wrong Scale}}{\text{R.F. of Correct Scale}} \right) \times \text{Measured Length}$$
2.  **Correct Area:**
    $$\text{Correct Area} = \left( \frac{\text{R.F. of Wrong Scale}}{\text{R.F. of Correct Scale}} \right)^2 \times \text{Measured Area}$$

## Quick Revision Notes

### Scale Classifications & Values
| Scale Type | Range / Condition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Large Scale** | 1 cm = **10 m or less** |
| **Medium Scale** | 1 cm = **10 m to 100 m** |
| **Small Scale** | 1 cm = **100 m or more** |
| **Draftsman Accuracy** | **0.25 mm** |

### Formulas & Rules
| Concept | Formula / Rule |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Scale Definition** | $\frac{\text{Map Distance}}{\text{Ground Distance}}$ |
| **Representative Fraction (R.F.)** | 1 / Denominator (Same units top & bottom) |
| **Scale Comparison** | Larger Denominator = **Smaller Scale** |
| **Shrinkage Factor (S.F.)** | $\frac{\text{Shrunk Length}}{\text{Original Length}}$ (Always < 1) |
| **Correct Distance (Shrinkage)** | $\frac{\text{Measured Distance}}{\text{S.F.}}$ |
| **Correct Area (Shrinkage)** | $\frac{\text{Measured Area}}{(\text{S.F.})^2}$ |
| **Correct Length (Wrong Scale)** | $(\frac{\text{R.F. Wrong}}{\text{R.F. Correct}}) \times \text{Measured Length}$ |
| **Correct Area (Wrong Scale)** | $(\frac{\text{R.F. Wrong}}{\text{R.F. Correct}})^2 \times \text{Measured Area}$ |

### Key Facts
* **Plan:** Large scale, horizontal details.
* **Map:** Small scale, covers large areas.
* **Graphical Scale:** Best for long-term use as it compensates for **paper shrinkage**.
