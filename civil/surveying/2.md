# Fundamentals of Surveying - Part 2
**Lecture Summary & Study Notes**

## 1. Introduction
* **Recap:** In Part 1, the primary divisions of surveying were discussed: **Plane Surveying** and **Geodetic Surveying**.
    * Geodetic surveying is used when the area exceeds **250 km²**.
    * In Plane surveying, plumb lines are parallel. In Geodetic surveying, plumb lines converge at the center of the earth.
* **Current Session:** Focuses on secondary classifications, principles of surveying, and units of measurement.

## 2. Classification of Surveys
Surveys can be classified based on three main criteria:

### A. Based on the Nature of the Field
1.  **Land Survey:** Performed on land.
2.  **Marine or Hydrographic Survey:** Performed on water bodies.
3.  **Astronomical Survey:** Observations of heavenly bodies.

**Sub-classification of Land Survey:**
* **Topographical Survey:**
    * **Purpose:** To determine the **natural features** of a country such as rivers, streams, hills, etc.
    * It may also include artificial features, but "natural features" is the primary keyword for exams.
* **Cadastral Survey (Revenue Survey):**
    * **Purpose:** To fix the **boundaries** of municipalities, states, and federal jurisdictions.
    * **Key Concept:** Property lines and legal boundaries.
* **City Survey:**
    * **Purpose:** Connected with construction works within a city.
    * **Examples:** Construction of streets, water supply systems, sewers, and other infrastructure.

### B. Based on the Object of Survey
1.  **Engineering Survey:** To obtain data for engineering works (e.g., design of dams, roads).
2.  **Military Survey:** To determine points of **strategic importance**.
3.  **Mine Survey:** To explore **mineral wealth**.
4.  **Geological Survey:** To study the different strata of the earth's crust.
5.  **Archaeological Survey:** To unearth **relics of antiquity** (civilizations, ancient sites).

### C. Based on Instruments Used
* Chain Survey
* Compass Survey
* Leveling
* Plane Table Survey
* Theodolite Survey
* Tacheometric Survey
* Photogrammetric Survey
* EDM (Electronic Distance Measurement) Survey

## 3. Basic Measurements in Surveying
To locate a point or determine relative positions, the following measurements (or combinations thereof) are taken:
* Horizontal distances.
* Vertical distances.
* Horizontal angles.
* Vertical angles.

## 4. Principles of Surveying
There are two fundamental principles of surveying.

### Principle 1: Location of a point by measurement from two points of reference
* To locate a new point (e.g., C), measurements must be taken from two known reference points (e.g., A and B).
* The line joining A and B is called the **Base Line**.
* **Methods of Location:**
    1.  Two distances (AC and BC).
    2.  One distance and one angle.
    3.  Two angles.

### Principle 2: Working from Whole to Part (Most Important)
* **Definition:** Establish a system of control points with high precision for the entire area (the "Whole") first, then fill in the details (the "Part").
* **Procedure:**
    1.  Major control points (A, B, C) are measured accurately.
    2.  Minor details inside this area are then surveyed.
* **Advantages (Exam Key Points):**
    * **Prevents accumulation of errors:** Since the main framework is accurate, errors in minor details do not add up to affect the whole survey.
    * **Localizes errors:** If an error occurs in a specific part, it remains restricted to that small area and does not affect the rest of the survey.
* **Contrast (Part to Whole):** If you work from "Part to Whole" (measuring small details and extending outwards), errors will accumulate and magnify as the survey progresses.

## 5. Basic Units of Length and Area

### A. British Units (Length)
* 12 inches = 1 foot
* 3 feet = 1 yard
* 66 feet = 1 chain (Gunter's chain)
* 100 links = 1 chain
* **Nautical Mile vs. Mile:**
    * 1 Nautical Mile $\approx$ **1.852 km**
    * 1 Mile $\approx$ **1.609 km**

### B. Metric Units (Length - Important Conversions)
* 10 mm = 1 cm
* 100 cm = 1 m
* 1000 mm = 1 m
* 1000 m = 1 km

### C. Units of Area
**British Units:**
* **1 Acre = 10 Square Chains** (Important Exam Question)

**Metric Units:**
* 100 $m^2$ = **1 Are**
* 100 Ares = **1 Hectare**
* 10,000 $m^2$ = **1 Hectare** ($10^4 m^2$)
