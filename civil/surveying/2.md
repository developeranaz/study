# Fundamentals of Surveying - Part 2

## Introduction
In the previous session, the primary divisions of surveying were discussed:
* **Plane Surveying:** Earth surface considered flat. Plumb lines are parallel. Used for areas < 250 km².
* **Geodetic Surveying:** Earth curvature is considered. Plumb lines converge at the earth's center. Used for areas > 250 km².

This section covers the secondary classifications of surveying based on various criteria, fundamental principles, and units of measurement.

## 1. Classification of Surveys

Surveying can be classified based on three main criteria:
1.  **Nature of the field of survey.**
2.  **Object of the survey.**
3.  **Instruments used.**

### A. Based on Nature of the Field
This classification depends on where the survey is being conducted.
* **Land Surveying:** Performed on land.
* **Marine or Hydrographic Surveying:** Performed in water bodies.
* **Astronomical Surveying:** Observations of heavenly bodies.

**Sub-classification of Land Surveying:**
1.  **Topographical Survey:**
    * Used to determine the **natural features** of a country such as rivers, streams, hills, etc.
    * Also includes artificial features.
    * 2.  **Cadastral Survey (Revenue Survey):**
    * Used to **fix boundaries** of municipalities, states, and federal jurisdictions.
    * Crucial for property definition and legal boundaries.
3.  **City Survey:**
    * Used for construction works within a city.
    * Examples: Construction of streets, water supply systems, sewers, and other infrastructure.

### B. Based on Object of Survey
This classification depends on the purpose or objective of the survey.
* **Engineering Survey:** To collect data for engineering works (roads, reservoirs, etc.).
* **Military Survey:** To determine points of **strategic importance**.
* **Mine Survey:** To explore **mineral wealth**.
* **Geological Survey:** To determine different **strata of the earth’s crust**.
* **Archaeological Survey:** To unearth **relics of antiquity**. 
### C. Based on Instruments Used
Named simply after the main instrument employed:
* Chain Survey
* Compass Survey
* Leveling
* Plane Table Survey
* Theodolite Survey
* Tacheometric Survey
* Photogrammetric Survey
* EDM (Electronic Distance Measurement) Survey

## 2. Basic Measurements in Surveying

To locate the relative positions of points, surveying involves measuring:
* Horizontal Distances
* Vertical Distances
* Horizontal Angles
* Vertical Angles

Not all measurements are taken in every survey; it depends on the method (e.g., Chain survey uses only horizontal distances).

## 3. Principles of Surveying (Vital Topic)

There are two fundamental principles of surveying. These are frequently asked in competitive exams.

### Principle 1: Location of a point by measurement from two points of reference
* A new point (C) is located by measurements taken from two fixed reference points (A and B).
* The line joining the reference points (AB) is often called the **Base line**.
* **Methods to locate point C:**
    * Two distances (AC and BC).
    * One distance and one angle.
    * Two angles.
    * 
### Principle 2: Working from Whole to Part
* **Definition:** It is essential to establish a system of control points with high precision for the entire area (Whole) first, and then fill in the details (Part).
* **Method:**
    1.  Establish main control points (A, B, C) covering the whole area with high accuracy.
    2.  Establish secondary points inside the main framework.
    3.  Survey smaller details within these sections.
* **Why Whole to Part?**
    * **Prevents accumulation of errors:** If an error occurs in a small part, it is restricted to that area.
    * **Localizes minor errors:** Errors can be identified and corrected within the specific section without affecting the whole survey.
* **Contrast (Part to Whole):** If you work from Part to Whole, minor errors magnify and accumulate as the survey expands, leading to significant inaccuracies at the end.

## 4. Units of Measurement

Understanding units is essential for both exams and practical field work.

### Linear Measurements (British & Metric)

**Common Conversions:**
* **1 Inch:** 2.54 cm
* **1 Meter:** 100 cm = 1000 mm
* **1 Kilometer:** 1000 m

**British Unit Table:**
| Unit | Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- |
| 12 Inches | 1 Foot |
| 3 Feet | 1 Yard |
| 5.5 Yards | 1 Rod / Pole |
| 4 Poles | 1 Chain |
| 10 Chains | 1 Furlong |
| 8 Furlongs | 1 Mile |
| 100 Links | 1 Chain |
| 6 Feet | 1 Fathom |
| 6080 Feet | 1 Nautical Mile |

**Key Distance Values:**
* **1 Nautical Mile** $\approx$ **1.852 km** (1852 m)
* **1 Mile** $\approx$ **1.609 km**

### Area Measurements

**British Area Units:**
| Unit | Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- |
| 144 Sq. Inches | 1 Sq. Foot |
| 9 Sq. Feet | 1 Sq. Yard |
| 40 Sq. Rods | 1 Rood |
| 4 Roods | 1 Acre |
| 640 Acres | 1 Sq. Mile |
| 10 Sq. Chains | 1 Acre |

**Metric Area Units:**
| Unit | Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- |
| 100 Sq. mm | 1 Sq. cm |
| 100 Sq. cm | 1 Sq. dm |
| 100 Sq. dm | 1 Sq. m |
| 100 Sq. m | **1 Are** |
| 100 Ares | **1 Hectare** |
| 100 Hectares | 1 Sq. km |

**Important Exam Conversions:**
* **1 Acre = 10 Square Chains**
* **1 Hectare = 10,000 $m^2$** ($10^4$ $m^2$)

    * **Answer:** Topographical Survey.
* **Question:** Survey to fix boundaries of fields/states?
    * **Answer:** Cadastral Survey (Revenue Survey).
* **Question:** Fundamental Principle of Surveying?
    * **Answer:** Working from **Whole to Part** (to prevent accumulation of error).
